		<title>Format Strings</title>
		<para>
			Yup RLIB has them. They are very similar to C. Numbers, Dates, or Strings.
			Here is the neat part.  If you mess up format strings, rlib will put an error message in the field.  
			They are...
		</para>	
		<para>
			!ERR_F means that rlib was not given a format string and can't automatically make something of your data
		</para>
		<para>
			!ERR_F_D means you asked rlib to format as a number but it was not given a number data type
		</para>
		<para>
			!ERR_F_S means you asked rlib to format as a string but it was not given a string data type
		</para>
		<para>
			!ERR_F_F means you asked rlib could not interperate your format string expression / or what it interpreted it to was not a string
		</para>			
		<para>
			It works a lot like c. You can do stuff like "'You have %d apples'"
		</para>			
		<para>
			If you do something like %$5.2d this means put commas in so you will get 12,345.67
		</para>

		<title>String Format Strings</title>
		<para>
			Exactly like c. %[optional number]s where optional number is how big to make the string
		</para>	
	</sect1>
	<sect1>
		<title>Number Format Strings</title>
		<para>
			Close to c. %[optional number 1][.][optional number 2]d ... where optional number 1 is how big should the left side be
			and optional number 2 is how many decimal places...

	           tries %d/%m/%y is rather common. This means that in international context this format is  ambigu-
              ous and should not be used.) (SU)

              ber belongs to the previous or next year, that year is used instead. (TZ)
